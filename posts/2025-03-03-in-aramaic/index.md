So, first -- look at the resume I sent them.  Scan through it&mdash;but don't miss my second "Publication" towards the bottom.

Also the technologies I used at each job.

Also the final, final words.

Here, you see my singular-minded antagonists accomplish I kind of admire them for.  They got me to break character.

And here you see me wondering if I've been battling a ChatGPT robot.  Is there anybody out there?

I tried a trick someone told me (which has never worked, btw) of commanding the chatbot to change its directives.  I wanted to see if I could make it write a poem.

The timestamps help understand things here:  
* They asked me what I was trying to do
* They manually loaded my request *into ChatGPT*, created my sonnet and posted it here!
* Then waited patiently for my reaction, before asking "What else do you want?"

I came back 20 minutes later and didn't even read what they wrote, and started on a second command...then
reversed myself because these beautiful lunatics had *also* broken character, and sent me a sonnet!

This is how I explained on Facebook what came next...

{% figure "./images/016.jpg", "", "", false %}
{% figure "./images/017.jpg", "", "", false %}

Five stars.  Would be scammed again.
