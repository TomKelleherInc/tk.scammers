This was a bit nutty.  Looking for a job, I turned on LinkedIn's little "#OpenToWork" banner on my photo.
And a flood of nonsense messages started coming in.  At points I was fielding 4 dialogs at once.

(One odd new behavior, is that several of them wrote 2-3 notes, immediately *deleted* them, then
started in with the standard pitch.  You'll see I decided to start the same way, for one of them.)

I'm also learning that scammers will take over someone's LinkedIn account, and then (sometimes)
pretend that they are a recruiter.  Even when the profile *plainly says they are a pharmacist*.

The discussion got dull for a bit, but then LO!, Amanda reclaimed her account from the scammers!  

Yay for Amanda!  (And she said it was okay to include this dialog here anyway.)
