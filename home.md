<h3>Okay, what do we have here?</h3>

I have fun with scammers.  

I've always loved absurdist humor.  Monty Python to Douglas Adams and so on.  My college buddy Steve
and I used to break each other up with non sequiturs and stentorian lunacy on the regular, and I never
really lost my love for it.  There's just something about when the rhythm and imagery and tone all just land right, and
you suddenly have a little nugget of insanity lodged in your brain's visual center.  

I use scammers to practice that art.

I try to not be abusive.  I don't scold them.  I don't lecture them.  When I am at my best
I am entirely *who they want me to be*: the patsy, the easy mark.  I am trying to
play along just as they'd hoped.  I just keep coloring outside the lines.  

I see how peculiar I can get before they bail on me.
